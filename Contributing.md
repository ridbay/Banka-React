# Contributing to RidBank

If you're reading this, you're awesome! Thank you for helping us make this project great and being a part of the RidBank community. Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

## Code of Conduct

RidBank has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it.

## A large spectrum of contributions

There are many ways to contribute to RidBank, code contribution is one aspect of it. For instance, documentation improvements are as important as code changes.

## Your first Pull Request

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)


If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you have started to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than a week, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.

## Sending a Pull Request

RidBank is a community project, so Pull Requests are always welcome, but, before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.

When in doubt, keep your Pull Requests small. To give a Pull Request the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per Pull Request. It's often best to create two smaller Pull Requests than one big one.

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/Banka-React.git
cd material-ui
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ridbay/Banka-React.git
```

3. Synchronize your local `master` branch with the upstream one:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

4. Create a new branch:

```sh
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

5. Make changes, commit and push to your fork:

```sh
git push -u
```

6. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/ridbay/Banka-React.git) and make a Pull Request.

The core team is monitoring for Pull Requests. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.
